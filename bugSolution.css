The issue with using `:has()` and pseudo-elements can be addressed by using a different selector. For instance, instead of targeting the parent based on the presence of a pseudo-element, we can directly style the pseudo-element itself or use a more general selector that doesn't rely on pseudo-elements.  Here's an example:

```css
div p::before {
  content: "Some Text";
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

This approach directly styles the `::before` pseudo-element, ensuring the desired style is applied without relying on the potentially unreliable behavior of `:has()` with pseudo-elements.
