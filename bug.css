The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue with the `:has()` pseudo-class where the selector might not work as expected with pseudo-elements::

```css
div:has(> p::before) {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

This code intends to target `div` elements that have a paragraph (`p`) child with a `::before` pseudo-element. However, the `:has()` pseudo-class in some browsers might not correctly recognize the `::before` or `::after` pseudo-elements as valid children, resulting in the styling not being applied.

This is uncommon because the `:has()` pseudo-class itself is relatively new and its interaction with pseudo-elements isn't as widely tested and understood.
